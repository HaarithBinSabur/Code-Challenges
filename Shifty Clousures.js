// Functional closures can get overly attached. Set them straight!

// Why doesn't greetAbe() actually greet Abe?

//===

/* This is a debugg problem. that task is simple but maybe in the words placed up above it is made diffiucult.
I myself did not understand what this problem actually ment. 
Because the problem is not wrong it just wants you to get the results of greetAbe(). So how do you solve it?
Erase Everything thats there and replace it with somthing that will console log both Ben and Abe.
Theres many ways to approch this actually ^_^*/ 



// let name = 'Abe'

// const greetAbe = () => 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

// name = 'Ben'

// const greetBen = () => 'Hello, ' + name + '!'



const greetAbe = () => 'Hello, Abe!';
const greetBen = () => 'Hello, Ben!';
