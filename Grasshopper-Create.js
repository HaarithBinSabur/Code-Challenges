// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
    room1: {
        name: "Room 1",
        description: "This is the description of Room 1.",
        completed: false
    },
    room2: {
        name: "Room 2",
        description: "This is the description of Room 2.",
        completed: false
    },
    room3: {
        name: "Room 3",
        description: "This is the description of Room 3.",
        completed: false
    }
};
